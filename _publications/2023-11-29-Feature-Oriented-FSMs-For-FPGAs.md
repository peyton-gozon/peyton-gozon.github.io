This paper is about bringing the advancements in software development to the hardware development world. We consider a 
Feature-Oriented Programming approach specifying Finite State Machines, which may be converted into hardware designs 
through [Chisel](https://www.chisel-lang.org/). 

My contributions include:
- Generating FSMs via the Cross-Product Composition
- Viewing the Game of Nim as a product of FSMs
