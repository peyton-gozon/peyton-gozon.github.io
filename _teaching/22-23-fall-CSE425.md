I served as the head TA of CSE 425S Programming Languages and Systems, taught by [Dennis Cosgrove](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~dennis.cosgrove/). The course 
is based on [materials](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/teachingMaterials/spl/) made by [Dan Grossman](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/), available as a MOOC on Coursea [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) (parts A through C).
